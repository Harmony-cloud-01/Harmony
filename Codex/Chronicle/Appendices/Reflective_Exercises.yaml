  - id: RE1
  name: Daily Reflection Mapping
  objective: Increase awareness of habitual patterns shaping perception.
  steps:
    - For three days, log recurring thoughts/actions/media touches.
    - Mark which support your core values vs. feel automatic/unhelpful.
    - Choose one stale pattern to re-symbolize and note the new reflection.
  outputs:
    - map_of_patterns
    - chosen_pattern
    - replacement_reflection

  name: Feedback Loop Identification
  objective: Spot and disrupt reinforcing cycles in a chosen app/feed.
  steps:
    - Pick one platform; sketch the cycle input→output→next_input.
    - Identify at least two novelty injection points.
    - Plan one concrete intervention and a metric to watch.
  outputs:
    - loop_diagram
    - intervention_plan
    - metric

  name: Promptcraft Practice
  objective: Reframe a limiting belief via language variation.
  steps:
    - Write a prompt that expresses a limiting belief.
    - Produce 3–5 reframed prompts exploring alternative perspectives.
    - Journal affective/insight shift after each variation.

  name: Spiral Design Action Plan
  objective: Apply the spiral cycle to a targeted change.
  steps:
    - Define Signal, Reflection, Iteration, Resonance for one habit/belief.
    - Track a 7‑day micro‑cycle with daily notes.
    - Adjust the micro‑plan based on resonance data.
  outputs:

  name: Symbolic Drift Awareness
  objective: Detect rituals that lost meaning; re-symbolize them.
  steps:
    - Pick one habitual phrase/act; trace its origin.
    - Decide: retire, refresh, or repurpose.
    - Define a new symbolic cue and checkpoint for review.
  outputs:
    - origin_note
    - decision
    - new_cue

  name: Epistemic Hygiene Check
  objective: Strengthen truth‑finding habits.
  steps:
    - Select a strongly held belief; list supporting sources.
    - Add two challenging sources and note contradictions.
    - Record one hygiene practice to adopt (e.g., time‑delayed sharing).

  name: Meta‑Filter Construction
  objective: Bridge clashing filters in a disagreement.
  steps:
    - Map attentional/emotional/narrative filters of both sides.
    - Draft a meta‑filter (phrase/metaphor/question) to bridge.
    - Test in a low‑stakes dialogue; log outcomes.
  outputs:
    - filter_map
    - meta_filter
    - test_notes

  name: Technocognitive Intimacy Reflection
  objective: Clarify boundaries with AI companions.
  steps:
    - Describe how an AI adapts to you and how trust forms.
    - List desired boundaries (topics, time, escalation).
    - Encode as usage rules or prompt preambles.
  outputs:
    - boundary_list
    - ruleset
  tags:
    - intimacy
    - boundaries

  name: Signal Reflection Creation
  objective: Create a brief daily reflection to guide perception online.
  steps:
    - Choose a cue (breath/gesture/phrase) used before media intake.
    - Tie it to an intention (learn, witness, rest).
    - Journal perceived differences over 5 uses.
  outputs:
    - cue
    - intention
    - mini_log

  name: Personal Feed Audit for Bias Awareness
  objective: Surface representation bias in your feeds.
  steps:
    - Over a week, log 10 items (news/ads/suggestions).
    - For each: who is centered, which narratives amplified/silenced?
    - Compare with a friend of different background; add 3 diverse sources.
  outputs:
    - audit_log
