# SDFT — Subjective Data Field Theory (CHRS v2.1)

> Draft @ 2025-09-01T01:08:26+00:00 (UTC) • Status: scaffold • Version: v2.1

## Overview
SDFT posits an ambient, context-sensitive **subjective data field** that shapes meaning before explicit cognition. This field couples a person’s memory traces, affective state, attention, and situational affordances.

## Core claims
- Subjectivity emerges from **field interactions**, not an isolated brain module.
- Perception and interpretation are **field-conditioned** (context-first).
- The field is dynamic and can be **measured indirectly** via proxies (attention, affect, context drift).

## Why it matters (for AI)
Context-aware systems must model “data weather”: stateful context that modulates interpretation, safety, and assistance quality.

## Interfaces
- **Inputs:** affect telemetry, attention cues, recent interaction graph, environment/context.
- **Outputs:** field summary (salience map), context vectors, drift/coherence indices.

## Metrics
- Field coherence index, context drift velocity, salience stability.

## Safety & Ethics
- Avoid context overreach; enforce consent, retention windows, and redaction policies.

## References / Lineage
- Predictive processing, situated cognition, ecological psychology.

## Change log
- v2.1: Initial CHRS scaffold.
