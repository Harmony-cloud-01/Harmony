# RCT — Resonant Coherence Theory (CHRS v2.1)

> Draft @ 2025-09-01T01:08:26+00:00 (UTC) • Status: scaffold • Version: v2.1

## Overview
Beliefs stabilize when **epistemic validity** and **emotional resonance** align. RCT defines the coherence threshold that sustains or shifts constructs.

## Core claims
- Data alone rarely shifts belief; **alignment** does.
- Misalignment produces **dissonance pressure**.
- Coherence thresholds can be estimated and tracked.

## Why it matters (for AI)
Trustworthy systems must model **truth-feeling alignment**, not just correctness.

## Interfaces
- **Inputs:** evidence strength, emotional valence/arousal, historical acceptance rates.
- **Outputs:** coherence score, alignment deltas, suggested alignment strategies.

## Metrics
- Coherence score (0–1), acceptance latency, relapse probability.

## Safety & Ethics
- Avoid coercive alignment; prefer transparent, user-led calibration.

## References / Lineage
- Dual-process theories, affective neuroscience, persuasion research.

## Change log
- v2.1: Formalized alignment scoring & thresholds.
