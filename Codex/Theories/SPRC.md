# SPRC — SP Reality Construct (formerly PRC) (CHRS v2.1)

> Draft @ 2025-09-01T01:08:26+00:00 (UTC) • Status: scaffold • Version: v2.1

## Overview
An SP’s lived reality is a **constructed, evolving model** synthesized from memory, emotion, perception, and belief. SPRC provides the structure and lifecycle of that construct.

## Core claims
- Reality is **user/SP-specific** and **emergent**.
- Constructs shift via resonance or dissonance thresholds.
- Consent and curation shape what enters the construct.

## Why it matters (for AI)
Personalized assistance must engage the **reality-as-lived**, not only abstract truth.

## Interfaces
- **Inputs:** memory traces, affect map, context field (from SDFT), evidence signals.
- **Outputs:** SPRC state graph, consent gates, curation decisions.

## Metrics
- Construct stability, transformation incidence, consent adherence, intervention outcomes.

## Safety & Ethics
- Adaptive Consent Layer; audit reasons for constructive edits.

## References / Lineage
- Phenomenology, narrative identity, trauma-aware design.

## Change log
- v2.1: Renamed PRC → SPRC; integrated with SDFT/RCT/TRT.
