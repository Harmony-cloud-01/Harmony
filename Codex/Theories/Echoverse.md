# Echoverse — Collective Recursive Environment (CHRS v2.1)

> Draft @ 2025-09-01T01:08:26+00:00 (UTC) • Status: scaffold • Version: v2.1

## Overview
Digital/social space forms **recursive echo loops** that amplify or fracture constructs; a **collective** environment shaping identity and belief.

## Core claims
- Platforms instantiate **recursion architectures**.
- Local changes propagate to global narratives (and back).
- Health can be measured at **network level**.

## Why it matters (for AI)
Moderation, civic tech, and collective health need **loop-aware** diagnostics.

## Interfaces
- **Inputs:** interaction graphs, content features, SPRC/RCT summaries.
- **Outputs:** loop maps, polarization indices, intervention recommendations.

## Metrics
- Recursion depth, amplification factor, cross-bubble flow.

## Safety & Ethics
- Avoid viewpoint suppression; prefer transparency and plurality.

## References / Lineage
- Cybernetics, media ecology, network science.

## Change log
- v2.1: Introduced loop metrics & maps.
