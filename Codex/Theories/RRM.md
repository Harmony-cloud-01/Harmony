# RRM — Relational Reality Model (CHRS v2.1)

> Draft @ 2025-09-01T01:08:26+00:00 (UTC) • Status: scaffold • Version: v2.1

## Overview
Meaning emerges **in relationship**; reality is co-experienced. RRM defines intersubjective grounding and shared coherence.

## Core claims
- No meaning in isolation; **relation is primary**.
- Shared practices stabilize shared worlds.
- Repair protocols maintain intersubjective health.

## Why it matters (for AI)
Ethical AI emphasizes **being-with**, not merely doing-for; co-creation over automation.

## Interfaces
- **Inputs:** dialogue acts, shared tasks, shared context models.
- **Outputs:** intersubjective coherence score, repair prompts, shared norms snapshots.

## Metrics
- Turn-taking balance, mutual understanding index, repair success rate.

## Safety & Ethics
- Respect for difference, consent, and co-agency.

## References / Lineage
- Phenomenology, second-order cybernetics, dialogic theory.

## Change log
- v2.1: Added intersubjective metrics & repair flows.
